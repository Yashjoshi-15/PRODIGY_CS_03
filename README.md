# PRODIGY_CS_03
Password Complexity Checker

This task was given by Prodigy InfoTech as a part of educational internship.
I recently developed a Python Password Complexity Checker which evaluates the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

# Criteria for Password Strength

-Length: Passwords should be at least 12 characters long for optimal security.

-Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters enhances security.

-Numbers: Including numbers adds to the complexity of the password.

-Special Characters: Special characters provide an extra layer of security.
